## ðŸ§© Usage
### 0. Install Requirements
We used python 3.9. All dependencies can be installed with the following command:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

---

### 1. Download Preprocessed ROI Signal
Phenotypes data of [ABIDE-I](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) is under `data/phenotypes`

Preprocessed ROI signal can be downloaded from AWS Cloud with the following command. Signal files will be downloaded to `./downloads/functionals/cpac/filt_global/rois_cc200`
```sh
python data_prep/download.py
```

---

### 2. Functional Connectivity Construction
Load the fMRI ROI signals and construct functional connnectivity:
```
python data_prep/preprocess.py
```

---


### 3. Split K-Fold data for cross validation
Data is splited according to test site and ASD/HC label, with the following scripts

```sh
python data_prep/data_split.py
```

The split will be saved to `data/split/default/fold_*`

---

### 4. Model Training and Inference
Latent Connectivity Auto-encoding
```
python src/pipeline.py -m -cn vqgae
```

Diffusion training and inference
```
python src/pipeline.py -m -cn ldm_training
```
